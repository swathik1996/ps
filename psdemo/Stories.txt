Deploy a secure micro-service in GKE as per below: 

Requirements: 
1. All infrastructure provisioning should be automated using terraform  (complete)
    a. Local/remote terraform state can be used 
    b. Use custom VPC 
    c. GKE cluster should not be public [1] 
2. Micro-Service should be deployed and managed using helm-charts (complete)
3. Micro-Service should be exposed via ingress (public / private) (complete)
4. Micro-service should be accessible using a DNS (http or https) (not complete - as i need to buy a domain)
5. Add unit test cases for Terraform code using Terragrunt (not complete)
6. Create an external data source (use Python script) to create below firewall rules with GKE provisioning: (completed using Terraform)
    a. Allow egress from nodes to GKE master 
    b. Allow all communication between nodes and pods 
7. Setup health checks for micro-services (not added as the microservice does not support it)
8. You can use sample application images available at [2] or create your own (used helloapp)
9. Document caveats/limitations if any Bonus points (not mandatory) 
    · Securing micro-service using HTTPS (no)
    · Using remote terraform state (yes)
    · Define restrictive network policies for micro-service namespace - default deny ingress and egress (will add)
    · Automated DNS records creation for the Service/Ingress (no)
    · Automated Certificate provisioning for the Service/Ingress (no)
    · Setup monitoring using stack driver (automatic)
    · Istio setup Guidelines (will add)
    · You can use GCP Free Trial accounts for this exercise (used)
    · GKE autopilot clusters are not allowed (ok)
    · Version control code in GitHub (will add)
    · README with step-by-step instructions to recreate the same from any local machine (not yet)
    · Clean and Readable Code (yes)
    · Code Reusability (yes)
    · Scalability (yes)
    · Automation (yes)
